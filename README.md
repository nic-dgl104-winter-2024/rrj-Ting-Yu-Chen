# Research and Reflection Journal



## Week 8



### Activities:

#### RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

Learn more about  programming languages -  [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)

- **What is the language used for?**

  Lua is an embeddable, extensible, lightweight language.Lua has a small and clean API, making it suitable for various applications, particularly those where a small and efficient scripting language is needed.

  It is a  general-purpose programming. Lua has implemented  for games , embedded systems and scripting environments.

- **Who uses the language?**

  - Scripting Environments

    Common usage is combine Nigx with Lua.Lua is utilized as a scripting language within the nginx environment to provide flexibility and extensibility in configuring and customizing the behavior of the web server such as Logical Processing and Log Control

  - Game Developers

    developers can create games by Lua.There are some famous examples such as Angry Birds which is mostly written in Lua and the mobile payment app -Venmo was built using Lua.

  - Software Developers

    Developers can use Lua to make code commucicate with GPIO.

- **What are some useful resources?**

- [Official Lua Website](https://www.lua.org/)

-  [Youtube - IOT with Lua](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=IOT+with+Lua)

- **Why are these specific resources useful?**

  1. [Official Lua Website](https://www.lua.org/)
     As a benginer offical website always has a good tortual to explain what is it about, and demstorate basic exampes
  2.  [Youtube - IOT with Lua](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=IOT+with+Lua) 
      When it comes to devices, situation become complex and it is hard to understand just by wordings.Thereby, programming for ITO purpose while watching a viedo step by step will make process efficient.

### Reflection:

I have learned that it's possible to combine different languages for a project. I have experience with Raspberry Pi, where I coded to communicate with various devices like GPIO and a buzzer Back then, I had to use a substantial amount of code and might end up discovering that the device was not functioning.  Another significant takeaway is that in such cases, Lua proves to be a suitable language for quickly implementing requirements. For example, if we design a light bulb for a device and want to check if the bulb is working or not, Lua is an easy language to use for testing purposes.

## Week 9

### Activities:

1. **READ “HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE”**

I used to search for issues for solutions and somtime comments under a issue to ask for help. I feel like someone being contributed to a project must be a expert, whcih I am still far away there. After reading this guide, I reilize that a densiner , a writer  and even a translator can also get involed with a project  and be part of members.Moreover, open source can also be a book and a recipe. What a fresh idea!

I choose Dart as I research langauge, and I am nearly newbie.Therefore finding issue or fix issue would be a tough chanellge for me. Hence I would like to fcus on document  or translation part, and standing on a shoe of a beginner , seeing what some information could be helpful.



1. **FIND POTENTIAL PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO**

   1. [bloc](https://github.com/felangel/bloc)

      it is definity a plguin I would love to use for a flutter project. The comunity is strong, there is also translation. However, as a beanner it would be helpful to have a api list , whcih give some explanation for usage.

   2. [fl_chart](https://github.com/imaNNeo/fl_chart)

      ![checklist_fl_chart](./assets/checklist_fl_chart.png)

   3. [flutter_carousel_slider](https://github.com/serenader2014/flutter_carousel_slider)

      ![checklist_flutter_carousel_slider](./assets/checklist_flutter_carousel_slider.png)

      

2. **IDENTIFY ISSUES TO SUPPORT**

3. **Contribute to singleton - Javascript document**

4. **Contribute to skeleton outline document**

   this week I learn to pull request and . Although the content to commit just few line, I still enjoy the process.

### Reflection:

This week I try to get involve to be a contributor for a project. Significant takeaway here is I think I am getting into the flow different people contribute to a project. It is total refresh and cool for me.
