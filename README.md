# Week 8



## Activities:

### RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

Learn more about  programming languages -  [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)

- **What is the language used for?**

  Lua is an embeddable, extensible, lightweight language.Lua has a small and clean API, making it suitable for various applications, particularly those where a small and efficient scripting language is needed.

  It is a  general-purpose programming. Lua has implemented  for games , embedded systems and scripting environments.

- **Who uses the language?**

  - Scripting Environments

    Common usage is combine Nigx with Lua.Lua is utilized as a scripting language within the nginx environment to provide flexibility and extensibility in configuring and customizing the behavior of the web server such as Logical Processing and Log Control

  - Game Developers

    developers can create games by Lua.There are some famous examples such as Angry Birds which is mostly written in Lua and the mobile payment app -Venmo was built using Lua.

  - Software Developers

    Developers can use Lua to make code commucicate with GPIO.

- **What are some useful resources?**

- [Official Lua Website](https://www.lua.org/)

-  [Youtube - IOT with Lua](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=IOT+with+Lua)

- **Why are these specific resources useful?**

  1. [Official Lua Website](https://www.lua.org/)
     As a benginer offical website always has a good tortual to explain what is it about, and demstorate basic exampes
  2.  [Youtube - IOT with Lua](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=IOT+with+Lua) 
      When it comes to devices, situation become complex and it is hard to understand just by wordings.Thereby, programming for ITO purpose while watching a viedo step by step will make process efficient.

## Reflection:

I have learned that it's possible to combine different languages for a project. I have experience with Raspberry Pi, where I coded to communicate with various devices like GPIO and a buzzer Back then, I had to use a substantial amount of code and might end up discovering that the device was not functioning.  Another significant takeaway is that in such cases, Lua proves to be a suitable language for quickly implementing requirements. For example, if we design a light bulb for a device and want to check if the bulb is working or not, Lua is an easy language to use for testing purposes.
